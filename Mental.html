They can do this by spreading awareness through talks and education, making it easy for students to find help when they need it, and creating a caring environment where everyone feels understood and accepted. When schools focus on mental health, they make sure students feel valued and confident to reach out for support, making the whole learning experience better for everyone.</font>
