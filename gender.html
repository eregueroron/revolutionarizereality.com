	<br><font size="5">Championing gender equality in our school is vital for creating an inclusive community where everyone, no matter their gender, gets the same opportunities and support. It's about unlocking potential, boosting confidence, and ensuring everyone can pursue their interests without facing discrimination. To support gender equality, we need to challenge stereotypes, encourage equal participation, and stand against discrimination. Simple everyday actions like using inclusive language and celebrating achievements equally can make a big difference. Let's work together to make our school a place where everyone feels valued and empowered to succeed, regardless of gender.</font>
