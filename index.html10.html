	Causes:<br>  
Digging into why poverty exists, we find it's a mix of big system problems and personal struggles. Not enough access to things like education, healthcare, and jobs keeps people stuck in poverty. And unfairness in society makes it even worse. Knowing these reasons helps us figure out how to fix things where it matters most.</font>
	<br><br>Stories of Resilience:<br>In the midst of poverty, we see people showing incredible strength and hope. Their stories of bravery, hard work, and cleverness shine bright. They've overcome tough times against all odds, inspiring us to keep going even when things are tough. It shows that determination can make a real difference, no matter the challenges.<br><br>
	
	<font size="10">Advocacy and Awareness</font><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
	<font size="5">Policy Advocacy:
To push for change, we start by making sure the voices of those who are often ignored are heard. We need policies that support their rights. By pushing for fair policies that focus on helping everyone and giving equal chances, we can break down the things that keep poverty going and make society fairer for everyone.

	<font size="5"><br>Education and Awareness Campaigns:<br>
Teaching and spreading awareness can drive important changes, giving people the power to make a real difference. By focusing on specific campaigns and projects, we draw attention to poverty-related problems, encouraging people to care and work together. This way, we can start a movement that brings us all together to make things better.
</font>
	<font size="5"><br><br>Volunteering and Donations:<br>
Even the smallest act of kindness can change someone's life for the better. By giving our time, skills, or resources as volunteers, we can support organizations working hard to reduce poverty in the Philippines. Whether it's mentoring, speaking out, or giving money, all of us working together can make a real and lasting difference.

	<font size="10"><br>Sustainable Solutions</font><br><br>
	<font size="5">Livelihood Programs:<br>
Programs that help people make a living in a way that lasts offer a way for them to take control of their economic future and improve their lives and families'. By supporting projects that encourage starting businesses, learning new skills, and connecting to markets, we can stop poverty from continuing and help people become more independent for good.
</font>
	<font size="5"><br><br>Education and Skill Development:<br>
Education is crucial for moving forward, opening doors to better opportunities and empowerment. By focusing on specific ways to make good education and job training more available, we can give people the skills they need to reach their full potential and build a better future for themselves.
